We will exhibit the manual implementation using Numpy, and then simplify it with JAX. Then, we will study the typical **XOR problem** by using a more advanced 2-layer **perceptron**. Finally, we generalize the use of neural networks in order to perform classification on a given set of audio files, using the PyTorch library, which will provide simplified implementation."

    "\n",
    "In most cases, classification problems are far from being linear. Therefore, we need more advanced methods to be able to compute non-linear class boundaries. The advantage of neural networks is that the same principle can be applied in a *layer-wise* fashion. This allows to further discriminate the space in sub-regions (as seen in the course). We will try to implement the 2-layer *perceptron* that can provide a solution to the infamous XOR problem. The idea is now to have the output of the first neurons to be connected to a set of other neurons. Therefore, if we take back our previous formulation, we have the same output for the first neuron(s) $y$, that we will now term as $y^{(1)}$. Then, we feed these outputs to a second layer of neurons, which gives\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will rely on the same loss $\\mathcal{L_{D}}$ as in the previous exercise, but the outputs used are $y^{(2)}$ instead of $y$. As in the previous case, we now need to compute the derivatives of the weights and biases for several layers . However, you should see that some form of generalization might be possible for any number of layer.  "
