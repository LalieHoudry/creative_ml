    "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional NNs (CNNs) rely on convolution in place of general matrix multiplication. They are specialized for processing data with a known grid-like topology and are among the best performing systems in classification/recognition tasks. Each layer in a CNN consists in a set of $N$ _filters_ called _kernels_, that are convolved across the input. If we denote as $\\{k^l_n\\}_{n\\in[1;N]}$ the set of kernels for layer $l$, these all share a unique _kernel size_. By convolving each one of its $N$ kernels across a d-dimensional input $x$, a convolutional layer produces $N$ d-dimensional outputs called _feature maps_, denoted as $\\{a^l_n\\}_{n\\in[1;N]}$. Hence, the computation of the $n$-th activation map in layer $l$ for input $x$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a^l_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} k^l_m \\star x_n + b^l_m\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, as depicted in the following Figure, the feature map corresponding to kernel $n$ consists in the sum of the d-dimensional discrete convolutions (denoted by the $\\star$ operator) between the kernel $n$ and each one of the d-dimensional data $\\{x_m\\}_{m\\in[1;M]}$, plus a bias $b$. A convolutional layer is thus a 3-dimensional tensor $h \\in \\mathcal{T}_{N,I,J}(\\mathbb{R})$ where $N$ is the number of features maps while $I$ and $J$ are respectively the _width_ and _height_ of the maps. \n",

    "## Implementing a CNN in `JAX`\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are going to start by implementing the whole network in pure `JAX`. This will allow us to get a sense of how low-level operations can impact the overall design in the learning steps. We start by importing the required libraries (`JAX`, `Optax`, and their related modules). As we are on an historic path, we will be using the [`MNIST` dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), which is a digit classification dataset used for a long time as a reference in machine learning to test models (this dataset is still widely used in order to perform benchmarking on low-level properties of a network or to perform debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick note on `JAX` vs. `Pytorch`\n",
    "\n",
    "In `JAX`, parameters are typically represented as plain numpy arrays or `JAX` DeviceArrays, and transformations on these arrays are expressed as **pure functions**. This approach is called **\"functional programming\"** and is a key feature of `JAX`. One advantage of this approach is that it allows for more explicit control over the state of the model. Since parameters are represented as plain arrays, it is easy to reason about how the state of the model changes over time. Additionally, it can be easier to implement certain optimizations (such as gradient checkpointing) using a functional programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `PyTorch`, parameters are typically represented as object-oriented modules, which encapsulate both the parameters themselves and the transformations that act on them. This approach is called **\"imperative programming\"** and is a key feature of `PyTorch`. One advantage of the object-oriented approach is that it allows for more flexible and modular code organization. Modules can be easily combined to create complex models, and the encapsulation of parameters and transformations within modules can make the code more readable and easier to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them may depend on the specific use case and personal preference. However, it is worth noting that `JAX` is generally better suited for large-scale machine learning applications, while `PyTorch` is often preferred for rapid prototyping and experimentation. Note also that several libraries exist for `JAX` that emulates this object-oriented behavior, and we will also be relying on those. Here are a few examples\n",
    "- [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a high-level API for defining neural networks and includes a variety of pre-built models and utilities.\n",
    "- [Stax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.experimental.stax.html) provides a functional API for defining neural network architectures with pre-built layers. \n",

    "# Music generation with LSTMs \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore how to use LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) for symbolic music generation with the help of `PyTorch`. Music generation with LSTM is a challenging problem where the goal is to train a model to generate new pieces of music that are musically coherent and similar to a given input dataset. However, there are several challenges associated with this task, such as capturing the long-term dependencies and structures that exist in music, dealing with the high dimensionality and complexity of musical data, and balancing the need for creativity and novelty with the desire for consistency and coherence. In addition, there is the issue of evaluating the quality of generated music, which can be subjective and context-dependent. Despite these challenges, recent advancements in deep learning techniques and models such as LSTMs have shown promising results in generating high-quality music, and the field continues to be an active area of research and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide here the blueprint for adressing this problem by using a \"mid-level\" approach. Compared to the previous problems, we will heavily rely on the pre-defined layers available in `Pytorch` and `JAX` (through the `Flax` library). However, we will still need to define the overall approach to solve this problem, notably for the data pre-processing, model and loss definition and the overall training loop. The major library we will be using is the `torch.nn` as follows "

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, symbolic music scores in computers come in the [MIDI format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI). MIDI files contain information about the _pitch_, _timing_, and _duration_ of musical notes, as well as other metadata such as tempo and instrument type. However, these are events that only provide information at various time positions. Hence, to train an LSTM model, the MIDI data needs to be converted into a suitable format that can be used as input to the model. This involves several preprocessing steps, such as **quantization**, **encoding**, and **normalization**. \n",
    "- _Quantization_ involves dividing the MIDI data into fixed time intervals and mapping each note to the nearest quantized time step. \n",
    "- _Encoding_ involves converting the quantized MIDI data into a numerical representation, such as a one-hot encoding or a continuous representation using embeddings. \n",
    "- _Normalization_ involves scaling the encoded data to a fixed range to ensure that the LSTM can learn meaningful patterns and avoid saturation or vanishing gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, preprocessing the MIDI data is a crucial step in preparing the data for deep learning with LSTMs and can have a significant impact on the quality of the generated music. However, as this is a quite complicated set of operations, we will rather rely on a dataset that has already been preprocessed and is one of the \"golden standard\" in symbolic music generation, the [JSB Chorales dataset](https://github.com/czhuang/JSB-Chorales-dataset)\n",
